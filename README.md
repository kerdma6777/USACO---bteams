# USACO---bteams
This program was written for the January edition of the [United States Computing Olympiad](http://usaco.org) 2013-2014 competition.  It was written in Java.  As per competition rules, after this program and two others were simultaneously released, I had four hours to complete as much as I could. 

#Program Description
 The full program description can be found [here](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=378).  

In summary, twelve integer values are read in.  These integer values are then grouped into sets of three.  The goal is to group these values in order to minimize the difference in the total sums of the sets.  The minimum difference in sums is the output. 

#Input
The input is 12 lines.  On each line is a value.

#Sample
This sample was taken from the [full program description](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=378).  

Sample Input (each comma represents a hard enter):

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
